Ever since I was a kid, video games have been a huge part of my life. I still remember the thrill of exploring virtual worlds and the joy of overcoming challenges, which sparked my fascination with technology and software development.

This passion guided me through my education at the University of Illinois-Chicago, where I learned about programming languages, algorithms, and game design principles.

As I approach graduation, Iâ€™m excited to dive into technologies like Unity, C#, JavaScript, and SQL, to broaden my horizons and find what I'm most passionate about.
